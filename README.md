Using tectonicdb to store binance orderbook and apply data analysis

# tech stack

1. tectonicdb: https://github.com/rickyhan/tectonicdb

remember to set tectonicdb upload to gcloud delete after upload to false


2. fastai: https://github.com/fastai/fastai

for python environment, I just use the same as fastai, I find the script for setting up conda env extremely easy to use, and basically for any data science project, you have almost all the libraries that you will need.
